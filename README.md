It doesn't use any package managerment tool, like cocoapods, in this repo. You don't need to install pods before build the project. Just double click FloatingButton.xcodeproj in the folder to open the project automatically. :)  

## Devleoping Enviornment 
*Xcode 10.2.1*  
*Swift 5*  

### Architeture

No architecture design in this project. As what I said, this is just a demo project to make floating button.

### TODO:
1. There is one issue about the new pop up view is not topmost some times (In the table view).
2. Clean up and organize code even better.
